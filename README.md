This repo stores code samples for illustrative purposes only.

Currently, each language-specific subdirectory contains an implementation of 
the Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate (ESD) test for outliers as well as 
unit tests replicating results from the paper where this test was originally proposed.

Each implementation of this test was based on the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology guide at `https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3//eda35h3.htm`.
